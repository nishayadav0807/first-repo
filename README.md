# First Repository

This is my first repository. I am starting to learn about github. So, there is nothing fun about this project. Its just I am trying to play around a bit with github. 


- Created Repository from github.com
- Vscode clone reposotory, from **source control** tab
- Add files as needed, from vscode. 
- Go to **source control** tab in vscode and **stage changes** for commit.
- Press **commit** button to commit your changes, and put a commit message.
